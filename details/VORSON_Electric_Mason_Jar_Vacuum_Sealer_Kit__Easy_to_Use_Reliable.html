I have done sesame seeds, dry and I believe they will last a lot longer this way on my shelf. I have also filled mason jars with home made soup - frozen it, and then vacuum sealed it. I did some research and it looks like this will be the best way to store it.The sealer is fairly easy to use. You need to make sure the silicone ring is not folded up and then press and hold to get it started. They say to vacuum for at least 20 seconds. There is an attachment to make it fit regular size lids. Without the attachment it will seal wide-mouth jars.",

They included jar lids which was nice. The photo doesn't show everything included, just the sealer, cord and manual. It even arrived fully charged.It passed the marshmallow test! I sealed a quart large mouth and half pint small mouth jar and they sealed well and the marshmallows expanded as expected. I let it run both times until it shut off on its own after a minute.The sealer is compact and I love that it's rechargeable. I had no trouble getting the sealer on and off the jars but using the small jar it took a fair amount of force. I did have some trouble removing the small mouth adapter but I have arthritis so that's my issue, not the sealer's fault. When the adapter is locked in place it's firmly attached and not going anywhere. I didn't have any problem with the small lid coming off when I removed the sealer from the jar. One just needs to be careful. I had no trouble with the gaskets coming loose. Everything stayed in place.We are primarily whole food plant based here. I have an extensive variety of beans, grains, pulses, dried fruit, herbs, nuts, seeds, you name it. The cupboard pictured is two feet deep and packed. There are more in the bottom half of the cabinet. I have a LOT of jars and to keep things fresh I like to have them vaccum sealed. Which is a pain if I have to haul out the sealer, vacuum lids and hose every time I open a jar or several-a daily occurrence. This little guy was MADE for me. It's compact to store easily, cordless, and easy to reseal a jar every time I use it. I truly couldn't be happier.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-01-21 16:55:38"},{"user":"Doug S","content":"Very easy to use!

This innovative device has made the process of vacuum sealing incredibly convenient and efficient.The kit includes an electric vacuum sealer with both wide mouth and standard mouth seal converters, catering to different sizes of Mason jars. This versatility is a major plus, allowing me to use it with a variety of jars in my kitchen.What sets this vacuum sealer apart is its ease of use. The upgrade to a high-performance motor is a game-changer. No longer do I need to manually pump the vacuum seal multiple times or deal with a cluttered desktop full of accessories. With just a press of a button, I can complete the vacuum seal in approximately 40 seconds or less. One of the key advantages of this vacuum sealer is its portability. Unlike traditional pumps with cords and tubing, this compact, rechargeable sealer is cordless, making it an ideal companion for traveling, camping, and picnics.Moreover, the USB cable provided for charging adds to the convenience, and the user guide ensures a smooth and easy setup process. I appreciate the thoughtful design that reduces food waste by extending the freshness of stored items.In conclusion, the Electric Mason Jar Vacuum Sealer Kit has exceeded my expectations. It's a reliable and efficient solution for anyone looking to enhance their food preservation methods. It's a valuable addition to any kitchen and has become an indispensable tool in my household.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-01-28 16:55:38"},{"user":"Dan","content":"I don't quite understand where some other reviewers have said they had trouble with this. Maybe they had defective lids or jars, or an issue with their sealer, but I had no issues. You put the sealing part of the lid on *only*, then the vacuum sealer over top. Push the button, and let it suck the air out. You kind of have to wiggle the sealer off, but it puts enough of a vacuum on that the seal isn't likely to come off. Screw on the retainer, and bam, you have a sealed mason jar ready to store.I was using 'Ball' brand wide mouth quart sized mason jars, which I found for 12/$14 at our local hardware store. This sealer comes with its own lids, but I used the ones that came with the jars.The only part I found a little difficult was re-opening the jars, because this puts enough vacuum on it that they are stuck on pretty well until that seal is broken. I see that as a feature, not a flaw.The item feels pretty sturdy, and stores nicely. I haven't sealed enough jars to see how many a full charge will get you, but after about 5 quart size jars it was down to 91%. That was just testing it with empty jars, which would have more air to pump out.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-02-05 16:55:38"},{"user":"Tolipa","content":"\r\nThe media could not be loaded.\r\n","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-01-29 16:55:38"},{"user":"Highwayman","content":"I recently added the Electric Mason Jar Vacuum Sealer to my kitchen arsenal, and I couldn't be happier with the decision. As someone who takes pride in making and preserving jams, pickles, and other goodies, finding a way to ensure they stay fresh longer has always been a priority. This vacuum sealer fits the bill perfectly.What really sold me on this product is its compatibility with the Food Saver system, which I already use and love. The seamless integration meant I could get started right away without any hiccups. But the true game-changer has been its ability to seal mason jars. It's incredibly simple to use and creates an airtight seal that's visibly tight, giving me peace of mind that my preserves will taste just as fresh months down the line as they did the day I made them.Using this vacuum sealer has been a straightforward and hassle-free experience. It's made a noticeable difference in the longevity and quality of my preserved foods, and I'm finding myself more excited than ever to experiment with new recipes, knowing I have the right tool to keep them fresh. Whether you're deep into the world of canning or just starting to explore, I can't recommend this vacuum sealer enough. It's truly made preserving food more enjoyable and less wasteful, and it's earned a permanent spot on my kitchen counter.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-02-07 16:55:38"},{"user":"MM","content":"These seem to be popular and we keep a large garden, so canning is a big part of that each year.There are situations where using the heating method for jar caning is not ideal.Having this as an options is a great alternative, also, for when you just want a quick solution for freshness.First, I thread it on regular mouth jars and wide mouth jars.As a test, I put marshmallows in one jar to visually see that air was being removed and it definitely is.Second, the strength of the seal is crazy good.I have let it seal for 25-35 seconds and later could not remove the inner lid with my fingers.I hade to use the included bottle opener, which I was glad to have in that moment.Lastly, the battery life is really good.I sealed 50 jars and didn't run the battery out completely.I will test and update the review when seal jars and run the battery out completely. to zero.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-01-28 16:55:38"},{"user":"Penneylane","content":"This is my new favorite Kitchen appliance.It seals both wide Mouth and small mouth Jars.It came with 5 wide mouth lids and 5 regular small mouth lids, a jar opener key, and instructions.It\u2019s very compact and easy to store when done.

I did some research and it looks like this will be the best way to store it.The sealer is fairly easy to use. You need to make sure the silicone ring is not folded up and then press and hold to get it started. They say to vacuum for at least 20 seconds. There is an attachment to make it fit regular size lids. Without the attachment it will seal wide-mouth jars.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-01-30 16:55:38"}];
