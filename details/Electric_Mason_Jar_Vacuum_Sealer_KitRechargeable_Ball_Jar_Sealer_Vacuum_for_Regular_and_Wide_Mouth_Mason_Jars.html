You still need to heat seal some foods to ensure they will be safe when you open it up again, but for the stuff that doesn't need it, this is amazing. Just slide this over your jar press the button and a minute later it's sealed and ready to go... or just sit there I guess. The unit itself is pretty small so it won't take up a lot of space when you don't need it and you can do a bunch of jars with a full charge (We did about 5 and it was still at about 97%). It can be used with different sizes, but just make sure the seal is set right or it won't work. It didn't for us the first time, but once we figured out the issue, it worked great. The only thing I would like to have seen done differently has to do with the lids that came included in the package. The ridge on the lids is not very deep so the included ones slide around a little on the jar opening. It can cause the lid to seal off centered. I was still able to screw on the cap, but it could cause problems. Using other lids we already had worked a lot better but since I figured it still worked, it wasn't worth downgrading my review. Plus, we tried to reseal the same lids (something you typically can't do) and it worked just fine. Very happy with this product and it may become a gift idea soon.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-15 16:55:38"},{"user":"N. D.","content":"This KIMIWUVI Mason Jar vaccum is SO convenient.Every time we have to open our stored vaccum sealed freeze dried and canned foods we always have to bring out the big messy FoodSaver machine.This takes the hassle of resealing our jars SO much easier for keeping the freshness.Functionally, It's very simple to use, just set the sealing lid on the jar, use the appropriate large or small self centering sealing adapter on the sealer, then you can step away to do other things because it automatically stops when it's vacuum is close to 100%.I'm not really sure about the battery life, because we haven't been close to running it down yet.Charging it is a breeze because it's USB-C, with a quick touch of the power button it gives you the battery remaining in percentages.The KIMIWUVI vacuum sealer came packaged with a five extra small and large good quality sealing lids, an opener for breaking the vacuum on the jars and a USB-C charging cable.The only small CON (not enough to remove a star) I can give this vacuum sealer is that it's not very fast, especially on large storage capacity jars.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-19 16:55:38"},{"user":"Stephen Lusk","content":"I like to make sauces ahead. This gives you a nice middle ground between canning and simple storage. I like to experiment with different Italian sauces. Being able to vacuum seal the jars lets them stay fresh for many weeks in the fridge whereas they might last a week or two. Can also vacuum seal dried stores, pasta and especially nuts which tend to go rancid. A neat and simple item.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-15 16:55:38"},{"user":"Erich Hans Bolewski","content":"I wanted to give this jar vacuum sealer a try because I make soups in a jar (dried beans, noodles, rice, dehydrated vegetables bouillon cubes etc.)for both gifts and for easy just add water meals.I am very happy with this vacuum sealer and find it very easy to use.It makes a good tight seal and because of that I am reluctant to try it for sealing liquids due to the powerful suction but for dry items its perfect.I am happy enough that I am going to get more of these sealers as gifts for family.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-05 16:55:38"},{"user":"J. Johnson","content":"This mason jar sealer kit is just what I was wanting for storing some tea and herbs.It works well, creating a tight seal that stays in place.I have used it with wide mouth jars since that is what I have on hand and it works great.I like that it has an flexible rubber ring to help guide the jar into the right place.It is really easy to use and it comes with several lids in the kit so I was able to get started right away.This is nice for keeping dry items fresh and in the future I will be using on pickles as well.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-08 16:55:38"},{"user":"RJ","content":"When I received this item, I opened the box, and literally moments later I had a nicely sealed jar.It was charged to 100% so I didn't need to wait, which would not have been a big deal, but the vacuum power seemed pretty impressive.I wish I had a gauge to quantify the level of vacuum, but the jar was impossible to open with my fingers, and still very difficult with the included opener, which was a nice bonus to have.Anyway, I had always wanted to do the old \"marshmallow test\" that I've seen on TV so many times.I had some mini marshmallows that may have been a little dry and older, but after using this sealer, they grew to about twice the normal size.I was pretty impressed.Then I broke the seal and they instantly shrunk back down to the normal size.I'm single but generally can't resist buying the \"family size\" groceries, or bulk items to save money, so I think I'll get a ton of use out of this.While it doesn't sterilize anything the way conventional canning does, I'm sure it will preserve the freshness of dried goods like crackers or nuts and help prevent them from going stale.Thanks for the great product.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-09 16:55:38"},{"user":"Mark B","content":"This sealer works just like it is supposed to!I needed it to keep my nuts and seeds lasting longer since I dont use them as quickly.These sealed well and I am pleased with using it again and again for everything I can think of that would stay fresh longer!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-17 16:55:38"},{"user":"Sandra Peterson","content":"\r\nThe media could not be loaded.\r\n","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-23 16:55:38"},{"user":"Dusted??","content":"\r\nThe media could not be loaded.\r\n","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-16 16:55:38"},{"user":"Adam Hill","content":"We vacuum seal our farm milk products in 1/2 gallon wide mouth jars, and this really helps get that done.While the temperature drop from cow udder to chill tank is usually enough, I don't like to take any chances, so this pulls the lids tight.I only wish I could have it stop at 30 seconds, but you can't really knock it for that","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-24 16:55:38"}];
