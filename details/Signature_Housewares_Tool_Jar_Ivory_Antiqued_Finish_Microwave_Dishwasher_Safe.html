Starnes","content":"I am more than pleased with this item, I am surprised. I have gotten used to not being satisfied with utensil holders because usually they are too narrow mouthed, too light and fall over, too plastic and fall apart, or way too expensive for a utensil holder. (designers, you know who you are). I think this is the best in its class!I love the subdued Green color I purchased it in. It is huge and makes me want to buy more utensils to put in it. Very sturdy and heavy to the point of you'll leave it where you finally decide to place it. Easily washable, with the usual unfinished narrow rough in the bottom circle to keep it from sliding on wet surfaces. ( ever see those glasses that magically skate across a counter?) I'm quite happy with it. I bought the matching salt/pepper and find them to be a little off in color, but that's another review. Enjoy your purchase of this. I am co-ordinating it with Fiestaware Plum, and they are complementary together if that helps anyone.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2013-02-09 16:55:41"},{"user":"Lauren","content":"We had a large burgundy jar that held our kitchen prep and cookware utensils but it said on the bottom \"do not use for food, for decoration only...Made in China,\" and just to be extra safe we decided to not use for kitchen utensils. I was very happy to find this one because the company is lead free. We purchased two so that I can have one sitting by the stove for cooking meals. The other is on by baking counter so I can put all those separate utensils in one spot.The jar has a nice width to it and is very large. The color is quite true to the photo, it is a nice soft green but probably is *slightly* more vibrant in real life. I can't really tell. I hand wash these but recommend putting down a sink mat or rack to protect it from slipping out of your hands just in case, since it is of a heavier weight. I personally like the weight of it to ensure that none of our utensils tip out.In sum, these jars are absolutely beautiful and functional basics in the kitchen...and lead free! :)We think these will last us a lifetime and would highly recommend making this small investment.P.S. If anyone is curious, the label on the bottom says it is \"Made in China.\" However, we do think these are made of quality.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2013-09-26 16:55:41"},{"user":"Jenni DaVinCat","content":"This tool jar was exactly what I was looking for.I had in on my wish list for a few months trying to decide if it was too big or too small and finally just decided to try it.In my old apartment, I had a huge amount of kitchen storage space but in my new place, I have much less.I didn\u2019t know what to do with all of my utensils, so I actually ended up just pulling out a small vase and using that on the countertop.That, however, was ugly and could only fit a few things anyways.This jar is great!The color (at least the red one) is true to the picture.The opening of the jar is more than wide enough to hold all of my utensils, which frees up plenty of drawer space.It\u2019s sturdy enough, and I\u2019m not worried about any utensils hitting it in the wrong way which could possibly chip or break it.It also adds a nice little splash of color to my otherwise (so far) bland kitchen.It doesn\u2019t take up much that much room, though it is a large tool jar.The only negative thing about this product was that I waited this long to actually buy something that would make my kitchen look better and be more organized.What was I thinking?!I\u2019d love to get the matching butter dish at some point as well.","purchase_model":"Color: Ruby Color: Ruby  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2015-07-28 16:55:41"},{"user":"Kathy Toth","content":"I am very happy to have replaced my older ceramic tool holder jar with this one,It is a bit larger, but that is a good thing.The tools are easier to find and remove/replace.I like the color and finish of the ceramic jar.It is a good purchase for me.","purchase_model":"Color: Ivory Color: Ivory  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-01-13 16:55:41"},{"user":"IrishLadyKelly","content":"These utensil crocks are a beautiful dark red, and I like the base being smaller than the top.

It held all my stuff, with enough room left over that I don't drag half of them out when I try to grab a spatula. It's also plenty wide and heavy that it stays put when you pull out your utensils.
