Having well selling containers is key, but they can still get in and flourish. So I wanted something that would vacuum to help that. additionally, a lot of the containers are plastic and I want to use glass as the bugs won’t bore through that. The set up is perfect! I was shopping for some other ones but I didn’t like the fact that they required special lids. The fact that this does both widemouth and regular mouth jars and just use the standard canning lids makes it super easy. This is perfect for storing rice, flour, pasta… And pretty much any other dry goods that we have cheaply and effectively.Now if we’re gone for a month or two at a time we don’t really need to worry about critters getting into things.",

Perfect if you store foods for long periods and prefer fresher tasting foods. I have a pressure cooker but don't always like to use it for canning. Especially if there's just small batches such as a handful of freshly picked herbs. And canning without needing to use heat is a great option. For example, I prefer to make a no-cook pizza sauce but usually make way more than for the pizzas I'm cooking that day. I use this to seal it up and even freeze it for a later use. Not to mention it's very easy to use.I like that it can handle both regular and wide mouth lids, and both parts attach together so they don't get misplaced. It's great for storing dry goods long term such as rice. Had an incident where my rice got infested. Got a new bag and after the first use, I portioned out the rest for later use. Some things that I used to freeze in lidded glass bowls, I no longer do. For example, soups are great to seal and freeze for later use.I can't get over how much I use this and appreciate how it helps all types of food last longer, while tasting fresher than other methods. I'm looking forward to using it more often and find myself searching the web for ideas. I definitely recommend.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-21 16:55:38"},{"user":"Jess","content":"Just a note because the advertising of these devices can be misleading: This is NOT a replacement for CANNING. These devices should ONLY be used on already shelf-stable food items. Home canning requires the heat from a hot water bath or a pressure canner, depending on what you are trying to preserve.I got this to use on the jars that I store dehydrated foods in, and for when I repackage store-bought shelf-stable foods (such as bulk rice, beans, etc), and it works great! Right out of the box the battery had a 60% charge (it shows on the top of the device when it has completed the process of removing the air from jars). I love how easy it is to convert it to use on wide-mouth jars (just twist to unlock and pull the bottom part off!) - The instructions were clear and easy to understand and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it came with 5 canning jar flats in both sizes, as well as a lid key to remove them without damaging them!I tried it now on both regular and wide-mouth jars and it has worked wonderfully on every jar I have used it on! Very pleased with this purchase!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-05 16:55:38"},{"user":"Max","content":"I got this to start storing my grains where they'll last longer and be protected from unwanted visitors. This thing works just like the name brand would and seals both wide mouth and regular sized jars. It's super simple to use and rechargeable with a type C port. This has quickly become one of my favorite kitchen gadgets! A great alternative to vacuum seal bags for those who want to avoid plastics.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-30 16:55:38"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"The Vacuum Sealer arrived in a tidy box, with everything you need included except the jar. It's a great starter kit for vacuum-sealing mason jars and works well with both regular-mouth and wide-mouth jars. Remember that this isn't \"canning\" for long-term storage. It can keep things like crackers, cereal, and nuts fresher for a bit longer, or your \"salad in a jar\" fresh for a few extra days in the refrigerator.For more information on canning, there are free resources from the National Center for Home Food Preservation at the University of Georgia. You can also search for the \"USDA Guide to Home Canning\" booklet, which is even available on Amazon Kindle. If you have some marshmallows, you can also do atmospheric pressure experiments with the kids and this vacuum jar sealer.

I\u2019m not sealing 2,000 pounds of flour or prepping for doomsday\u2014just trying to keep bugs and critters out of my pantry. This sealing kit works perfectly for creating smaller, manageable units of storage, which is ideal for my everyday needs. It\u2019s straightforward and quick to use, so I don\u2019t have to fuss with complicated setups, and it works with both wide-mouth and regular-mouth mason jars, which saved me from having to buy special jars. Its compact design makes it easy to store in a drawer, saving valuable kitchen space. My only gripe is the short cord, which can be a bit inconvenient if you\u2019re using it far from an outlet.

Having well selling containers is key, but they can still get in and flourish. So I wanted something that would vacuum to help that. additionally, a lot of the containers are plastic and I want to use glass as the bugs won\u2019t bore through that. The set up is perfect! I was shopping for some other ones but I didn\u2019t like the fact that they required special lids. The fact that this does both widemouth and regular mouth jars and just use the standard canning lids makes it super easy. This is perfect for storing rice, flour, pasta\u2026 And pretty much any other dry goods that we have cheaply and effectively.Now if we\u2019re gone for a month or two at a time we don\u2019t really need to worry about critters getting into things.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-28 16:55:38"}];
